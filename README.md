## What is this?

My solutions to [The C++ Programming Language (4th Edition)](https://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html) by [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.stroustrup.com/).

## Something is missing!

Chapters will be added as I solve them. Older chapters might be missing because my solutions are quite old and not formatted using Markdown. I might eventually add them when I have enough time.

## bUt The bOoK iS oLd!

I do consider C++11 to be old. Nevertheless, many practices, constructs and idioms presented in the book are still relevant today.
